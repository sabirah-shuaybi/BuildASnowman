# BuildASnowman

This program allows the user to construct a snowman from three different sized circles. The user must drag
the circles into position. When the circle is generally in the right position, the program helps secure 
the circles into place. When the circles are snapped into place, the program displays a message to the user 
stating, "Good Job!" and at this point, the program locks the circles into place, 
preventing any further movement of the snowman spheres.
